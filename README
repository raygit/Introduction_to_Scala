This repository serves as a dump of the stuff i'm 
brainstorming for my talk to the Singapore developer
community on "Introduction to Scala" around GeekCampSg
due to happen sometime in the 3rd Quarter of 2013.

As places for topics are limited, the organizers would only 
allow talks to happen when enough votes are met. So please
go to http://geekcamp.sg to vote for the talk :)

The idea is to introduce Scala to the developer community in Singapore
and how it is both a practical and interesting programming language
which should be in the arsenal of every developer who practices functional 
programming in Scala 

I expect the presentation slides to be made available here
or on my account on slideshare.net 

I expect the demo code to reside here too.
