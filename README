This repository serves as a dump of the stuff i'm 
brainstorming for my talk to the Singapore developer
community on "Introduction to Scala" around GeekCampSg
in September 2013.

At this point onwards, i normally keep this repository 
as a means to document some of the experiments i'm working on
like a scratchpad.
