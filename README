This repository serves as a dump of the stuff i'm 
brainstorming for my talk to the Singapore developer
community on "Introduction to Scala" 

The idea is to introduce Scala to the developer community in Singapore
and how it is both a practical and interesting programming language
which should be in the arsenal of every developer who calls themselves
functional programmers.

I expect the presentation slides to be made available here
or on my account on slideshare.net 

I expect the demo code to reside here too.
